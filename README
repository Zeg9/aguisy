AGuiSy
======

AGuiSy is A GUI SYstem that works with OpenGL and SDL.
Documentation will come soon, once everything works (well, not soon actually ;-)

Current development state
=========================
For the moment, it does nothing more than rendering text.

Compiling the library
=====================
The library requires SDL, GLEW, OpenGL to be available on your system.
Compiling usually consists of a few steps:
$ cd aguisy
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. && make
# make install

Running the demo
================
To compile the demo, you first need to have installed the AGuiSy library.
It also requires SDL_image in addition to the library's dependencies.
After this is ready, the commands are similar to the previous ones:
$ cd demo
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. && make
$ ./aguisy-demo

You can also install it system-wide with
# make install


Using this in your own projects
===============================
If you use cmake, copy the FindAGuiSy.cmake file, it is available in //demo/cmake/
If you compile with gcc, you just have to add -laguisy to the linking part.
For other systems, well... You probably know them better than me.
